# "Shared Graph" Reconstruction

## Overview
Exploring the idea of reconstructing an original graph `G` from two graphs derived by a "node-split" operation `A` and `B`.  

The node-split operation replaces each node in the original graph with *N* new nodes while *mostly* keeping their connections to the original parents and children. The goal is to determine whether it is possible to reconstruct the original graph `G` from the resulting pair of altered graphs `A` and `B`.
