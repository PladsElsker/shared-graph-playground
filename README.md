# Shared Graph Reconstruction Playground

## Overview
Exploring the idea of reconstructing an original graph `G` from two graphs `A` and `B` derived by a "node-split" operation.  

The node-split operation replaces each node in the original graph with *N* new nodes while *mostly* keeping their connections to the original parents and children. The goal is to figure out whether it's possible to find the original graph `G` from the pair of altered graphs `A` and `B`.
